## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ZHANGJialiHappy/website/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
1. create repository with readme, than create Gitub Pages.
2. use iTerm to go to file (cd), check file (ls), git clone to my computer
3. use visual studio code to open and change readme, push it to gitub
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
New learner, learn to git commit and git push.
